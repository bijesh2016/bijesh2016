    <p class="description">Siddhartha Gautama, the Lord Buddha, was born in 623 B.C. in the famous gardens of Lumbini, which soon became a
        place of pilgrimage. Among the pilgrims was the Indian emperor Ashoka, who erected one of his commemorative
        pillars there. The site is now being developed as a Buddhist pilgrimage centre, where the archaeological remains
        associated with the birth of the Lord Buddha form a central feature.

    <img src="./images/6.jpg" alt="Error loading media">
    <p class="description">Pokhara's spellbinding beauty has been the subject of many travel writers. Its pristine air, the spectacular
        backdrop of the snowy peaks of the Annapurna Range and the serene Phewa, Begnas and Rupa Lakes, makes this
        destination 'the Jewel of the Himalaya'.
        Pokhara is full of natural, cultural, and geographical landmarks and among such are Bindhyabasini temple,
        Devid's Fall, World Peace Pagoda, and Numerous caves in the region. Either a scenic drive or a tremendous
        mountain flight brings visitors in Pokhara.
