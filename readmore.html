        <h2>Possibilities of Tourism in Nepal</h2>
        <p class="description">The Possibility of Tourism in Nepal is actually, at a potentially high level. This has to do with its
            geographical location, its culture and traditions, landmarks, and probably the most important factor, is its
            natural beauty. Nepal has many forests, mountain valleys, and river trails. This is a major attraction to
            tourists who seek out quiet time with their families. Many travelers like to explore the nature and culture
            of the people. Nepal offers 101 ethnic groups with over 92 different languages. With vast culture and
            traditions, it is always a treat for the foreigners to observe the life of different communities in Nepal.

            The mountain valleys hold the high snow peak mountains. Some famous ones are probably Everest, Annapurna,
            Kanchenjunga, Manaslu, Mardi Himal, etc. All the trails around the mountain region are being developed at a
            rapid pace with many hotels and lodges being set up all around the routes. Foreigners or travelers who visit
            Nepal, love to watch the high mountains and the trekking option available around these mountain trails. </p>
        <h2>Present Situation of Tourism in Nepal </h2>
        <p class="description">The situation of the Tourism industry in Nepal has taken a dire turn. This year, which was supposed to be the
            #visitnepal2020 (the slogan for the tourism year) went in ruins for the country. With the coronavirus
            outbreak in Wuhan, China the virus has spread throughout the world. With travel bans and countries in
            lockdown, no one wants to leave their home. This has affected the tourism industry very hard. With the loss
            inflow of tourists, many organizations, companies, and businesses in the country are having a hard
            economical downfall. On March 30, 2020, the total cases for the coronavirus reached a total of 740,000
            people who tested positive. It would have been easier if there was a cure for this pandemic. However, as the
            virus is never seen before type, the cure is still not available. The total number of people dead in the
            world crosses 35000. In Nepal, 4 deaths were confirmed with no accurate data of the positive number of cases
            reported. With such a situation in the world, travelers were banned from going out of their country. Even in
            Nepal, quarantine has become a usual activity since March 24, 2020. With every business that depends on
            tourism for a proper income generation, it all came to a Halt until further notice. </p>
