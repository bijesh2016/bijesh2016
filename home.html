        <h1>Tourism</h1>
        <p class="description">Nepal is known for being one of the most famous travel destinations in the world. With
            thousands of tourists
            visiting the county every year, Tourism in Nepal has soared to new heights. Nepal has become a popular
            tourist
            hotspot. The capital city of the country, Kathmandu and the city of lakes, Pokhara are the top cities in the
            country to see a sharp increase in the number of tourists in recent years. With trekking routes to Everest
            and
            Annapurna flooded by foreigners throughout the year, the trekking has added a boost to increase the tourism
            market. From UNESCO world heritage sites to different ancient landmarks, from a diverse ethnic community to
            experiencing different cultures and traditions, all of which have been successful to catch the interest of
            foreigners to visit the country of Nepal.
        </p>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p class="description">The Scope of tourism in Nepal extends from the east to the west, from the north to the
            south, from the air and to
            the land. With many rivers, lakes and water sources in the country, rafting and boating have and can become
            a
            better attraction to foreigners. The paragliding, hot air balloon, bungee, and Zipline through the air are
            seeing more interaction for foreign adventurers. Mountain biking, trekking, city tours, and site visits, and
            jungle safari is definitely one that brings excitement to travelers and foreigners by connecting them with
            the
            local traditions and culture and with the pristine natural atmosphere of Nepal. All of this plays a vital
            role
            to increase the scope of the tourism industry throughout the country. Every year new adventure activities
            like
            rock climbing and trekking adventures are popping up one after another in the country. If the Government of
            Nepal can manage all of its resources properly, the tourism sector of the nation can grow to greater heights
            in
            the international tourism sector.</p>
